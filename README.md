# my_index_full

This is a scaffolded personal website template using **React + Redux Toolkit + Vite**, designed to showcase projects, skills, and academic work. It integrates **EmailJS** for the contact form and can link to external Streamlit apps for project demos.

## How to use

1. Run the scaffold script (this file) which generates the project folder and files.
2. Change directory into the generated project:

```bash
cd my_index_full
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

4. Start dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open https://my-index-full.pages.dev/

## Deploy

- **Vercel**: connect the repo and deploy (Vite supported automatically).
- **GitHub Pages**: if you want to deploy to GitHub Pages, install gh-pages and run `npm run deploy`.
  Make sure `homepage` or `base` is set when using a repo subpath.

## Customization

- Edit `src/store.js` to set your name, bio, skills and projects.
- Edit styles in `src/styles.css`.
- Add your avatar to `public/avatar-placeholder.png`.
